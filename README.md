# Bidding System

The Bidding System is a Python application that allows users to conduct an auction or bidding process. Participants can place bids, and the system determines the highest bidder at the end of the auction.

This project is designed to demonstrate Python programming concepts such as user input, loops, conditional logic, and file handling.
